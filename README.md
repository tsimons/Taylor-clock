# Analog Clock

Simple clock that determines the angles of the various hands

## Problem

Given a standard, circular, twelve-hour analog clock, implement a simple, tested, quality application that can, for the input of any time (HH:MM), output the following:
 
* the clockwise angle, in degrees, of the hour hand
* the clockwise angle, in degrees, of the minute hand
* the acute angle, in degrees, between the hour hand and minute hand
